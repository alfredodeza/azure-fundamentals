### Azure IoT Hub

Definition: Managed service hosted in the cloud. Central hub for bi-directional communication with devices and the cloud.

Features:

* Device-to-cloud telemetry
* File upload from devices
* Control devices from the cloud
* Monitoring of device creation, failures, connections

Key difference with IoT Central: More control, less managed (no dashboard). Telemetry analysis.

### Azure IoT Central

Definition: Builds on IoT Hub with a dashboard to connect, monitor and manage IoT Devices

Features:

* Dashboard for managing devices
* Push firmware updates to devices
* Provides starter templates for common scenarios

Key difference with IoT Central: Less control, more managed (dashboard included). Telemetry analysis.

### Azure Sphere

Definition: End-to-end, secure IoT solution. From hardware to OS and messaging from the device to the message hub.

Three parts:

1. **Azure Sphere Micro-Controller (MCU)**: Processes OS and signals from attached sensors.
1. **Custom Linux OS** that handles communication with the security service
1. **Azure Sphere Security Service (AS3)**: Makes sure the device hasn't been compromised

Features:

* Built-in communication and security features for IoT devices

## Azure AI Fundamentals

LM https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/ai-machine-learning-fundamentals/

### Azure Machine Learning

Features:

* Define how to obtain, handle, and split data in training and test sets.
* Train and evaluate modules with programming languages like Python
* Pipeline creation for compute-intensive tasks
* Best-algorithm deployment with an API to a REST endpoint

### Azure Cognitive Services

Definition: Provides pre-built ML models to see, hear, speak, understand and reasoning.

Features:

* Solves generic problems, like text sentiment analysis, image or face recognition

4 categories:

1. Language: Process NLP
1. Speech: Speech-to-text, and text into natural sounding speech. Language translations
1. Vision: Analyze and recognize pictures, videos or other visual content
1. Decision: Automatic and Personalized recommendations for users. Detect abnormalities in Time Series data.

### Azure Bot Service and Bot Framework
