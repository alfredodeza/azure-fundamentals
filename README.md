This repository has _my own notes_ but you should create yours as part of studying for the course. I show you how I did it below ðŸ‘‡

Sample repo structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ 1-cloud-concepts.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 2-core-services.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 3-core-solutions.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 4-security.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 5-governance-compliance.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 6-cost-management.md
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

1. Create a repository and add 6 markdown files, one for each section
1. Start summarizing, adding the Learning Path and Learning Module for each section
1. Capture services, definitions, and any key differentiators

Sample section:

```
## Main topic

### Service Name

Definition: Some definition

Features:

* Feature 1
* Feature 2
```

Find key differences for similar services. For example, IoT Hub vs. IoT Central:

**IoT Hub:** More control, less managed (no dashboard). Telemetry analysis.

**IoT Central:** Less control, more managed (dashboard included). Telemetry analysis.
